# Resume here

_Last updated: 2026-10-08, end of the session that built Follow-up Program stages 2a, 2b and 3 (stage 1 the day before). Read this first, then `HANDOFF.md`
(full dated log) and, for design work, `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/followup/SPEC.md`. Update this file at the end of
every session: replace "Where things stand" and "Next steps", and add to "Learnings" (never delete a learning)._

## 1. Where things stand
| Piece | State |
|---|---|
| Tour page (`Code.gs`, `Index.html`) | Version 2026-10-06.4 pushed and merged to main; **not deployed** by the user as far as we know. Live: 2026-10-01.4 (confirmed 2026-10-01). Ask the user before assuming. |
| Follow-up Program design | Final: `docs/followup/SPEC.md` + mock-up `docs/followup/mockup.html`. Build plan with the choices the spec left open: `docs/followup/STAGE1_PLAN.md`. |
| Follow-up stage 1 (server) | **Built and tested**, not run on real Google: `followup/Code.gs` + `test/followup.test.js`. |
| Follow-up stage 2a (page) | **Built and tested** in a browser against the simulated sheet, not run on real Google: `followup/Index.html` + `doGet` + `test/followup.page.test.js`. One-week calendar, date list (2 weeks, "Show 2 more weeks"), cards, select several dates, repeat, confirmation list, Release, 12-hour rule, phone/tablet/laptop. English only. |
| Follow-up stage 2b (page) | **Built and tested** (same limits as 2a): "Who" button (speaker list with first-time mobile, typed others, Include me too), group confirmation, ✕ per person you registered, "Release all N for this date", My registrations (count + next date + Show), red cancellation notice (names the people you registered), language switch with Telugu and Hindi (**not checked by native speakers**), server messages translated. Page version followup-2026-10-08.2. |
| Follow-up stage 3 | **Built and tested** (simulated): sheet menu Program -> "Cancellation WhatsApp list" (dialog, one green Open WhatsApp button per affected person, own mobile) and "Mark cancellation notices as sent" (Yes/No naming the dates); both need the sheet's menu and return nothing, so the public link can't use them. Setup guide `followup/SETUP_GUIDE.html` (13 parts, Copy buttons) built by `tools/build_guide.py` from `tools/followup_guide_template.html`. "Who" button moved to the top under Mobile (user request). Version followup-2026-10-08.3. |
| Follow-up columns (2026-10-08, user's sample) | Program plan titles renamed by the user: Day of the Week, Start Time, End Time, Institution Name, Volunteers Needed, **Principal Contact** (new; shown under "Details" on each card - phones need a tap, tablets/laptops show it), Sahaji Contact (was Contact: shown when release is closed). Slots titles renamed to match. Old titles still accepted (`COL_ALIASES`). **One value per line** (user's choice): lists in Day of the Week / Week of month / Day of month are refused and listed in the Update report (they used to be silently cut to one value - a stage-1 bug). Week of month accepts 5th (months without one skipped) as well as last. Version followup-2026-10-08.4. |
| Follow-up stage 4a (2026-10-08) | **Done**: volunteer demo videos `docs/followup/demo.mp4`, `demo-te.mp4`, `demo-hi.mp4` (user's sample data, phone numbers replaced); demo button plays the GitHub copies (commit becaae3) until the user sends Drive links. Next: 4b (Ongoing scene in the tour videos), 4c (organiser video), each under 100,000 tokens (user's choice). |
| Follow-up stages 4b, 4c (2026-10-08) | **Done**: tour videos with the Ongoing scene (the user replaced the 3 tour Drive files on 2026-10-08); organiser video `docs/followup/organiser-demo.mp4`, linked from the setup guide (Drive link first, GitHub copy second). All planned stages are built. |
| Follow-up stages 4, 4b | **Started 2026-10-08**: demo button + player on the page (copied from the tour page; hidden while `DEMO_VIDEO_URLS` is empty); narration and captions drafted in `docs/followup/demo-script.md` (A: Follow-up video en/te/hi, B: one Ongoing programs scene added to the tour video, C: organiser video, English). **Wording approved by the user 2026-10-08 (as written). Recording waits for the user's real-setup report** (their choice, so the videos show the page as it really looks). |
| Live names (user, 2026-10-08) | Google Sheet **"HYD-SY Follow-up Programs"**, its Apps Script project **"Follow-ups Planner"** (used in the setup guide and the organiser video). |
| Repository (since 2026-10-08) | **`csreenath-rgb/program-planner-sahaja-hyd`, branch `main`** - the user's own repository for this work; work and push here. The old branch `claude/vibrant-planck-gsxjay` in `MamtaMukeshK/task-self-assign-sahaja-hyd` is only a backup copy (never merged into that repository's main, at the user's wish). |
| Branch (before 2026-10-08) | `claude/vibrant-planck-gsxjay`, pushed, up to date. No pull request (the user has not asked for one). |
| Follow-up page, 2026-10-08 evening | Version followup-2026-10-08.6 (commit 464fdb3): call buttons and Details (Principal + Sahaji contact) like the tour page. **Waiting on the user:** paste followup/Index.html + Code.gs, New version; send the live Slots title row + a phone screenshot (likely cause of missing details: Slots tab from the old sample has no "Principal Contact"). History check: nothing missing from the fork. |
| Tests | `cd test && npm install && npm test`: 92 tests (2026-10-08 evening); earlier: 90 tests (77 tour page + 10 Follow-up server + 3 Follow-up page/guide), passing on 2026-10-08. (The tour "demo video button" test was intermittent in full runs; fixed 2026-10-08, 10 full runs in a row passed.) |

## 2. Waiting on the user (do not build past these without an answer)
1. ~~Confirm the 5 stage-1 assumptions~~ **All 5 confirmed by the user 2026-10-08** (details in `docs/followup/STAGE1_PLAN.md`):
   a. "Line ID" column added to Program plan (P1, P2..., filled by the script; needed because row numbers change).
   b. "Contact" column added to Slots (copied from the plan; can differ per date).
   c. Empty "Until" = keep 12 weeks of dates ahead, topped up every Sunday; never more than 1 year ahead.
   d. "Release all N" also releases the registrar if they are on that date.
   e. Times typed without AM/PM are 24-hour; the time columns display AM/PM so mistakes show at once.
2. Narration approved (2026-10-08). **The user sets up the new sheet with `followup/SETUP_GUIDE.html` (first run on real Google) and reports what they
   see.** Fix whatever differs before stage 4. Ideally a native Telugu and a native Hindi speaker check the page's
   wording (`TEXT.te` / `TEXT.hi` in `followup/Index.html`).
3. Older open items in `HANDOFF.md` "Next step": deploy tour version 2026-10-06.4; (demo videos for Ongoing programs: moved to stage 4 by the user 2026-10-08);
   native-speaker check of Telugu/Hindi; whether the built-in first-day data reaches the live tour page.

4. **Found 2026-10-08:** branch `claude/zealous-johnson-h19h6w` holds tour version 2026-10-07.1 (still-needed counts kept
   correct automatically; call buttons for numbers on phones; 79 tests) from a parallel session. It is in neither `main`
   nor this branch. This branch (27 commits ahead of main, no pull request yet) never changed the tour's `Code.gs` /
   `Index.html`, so merging both should clash only in HANDOFF/ARCHITECTURE/SETUP_GUIDE. Ask the user which tour version is
   live and whether to merge both into main.

5. **2026-10-08 (later):** done: main merged into this branch (tour 2026-10-07.1), Drive links, Week of month 1st-5th
   only. Waiting: the user forks to csreenath-rgb and connects it; the user's go to resume 4b (paused mid-way, see the
   HANDOFF entry of the same date); "Custom" answered: not needed (one line per day/time; P7 = One-off in demo data). This branch must NOT be merged into main (user wants it
   kept as a separate repository).

## 3. Next steps (in order)
1. The user follows `followup/SETUP_GUIDE.html` on real Google. Things to watch in their report (all moderate
   confidence, never seen on real Google): the "Program" menu appears; set-up creates the tabs and the Sunday trigger;
   '2026-10-17' / '18:30' written by the generator become a real date and time; times show as "6:30 PM"; the page loads
   with the first 3 weeks; the WhatsApp dialog's links open WhatsApp (dialogs are sandboxed; `<base target="_blank">`).
2. Stage 4 (demo videos for the Follow-up page in English, Telugu, Hindi, plus the Ongoing programs videos moved here
   by the user) and 4b (organiser video): see SPEC section 5 and HANDOFF "Re-record the demo". Narration text approved
   by the user first. Low-confidence estimates: 60,000-100,000 and 30,000-50,000 tokens; split if over 100,000.
   Server functions the page uses, for reference (all in `followup/Code.gs`; `doGet` serves the first 3 weeks):
   - `getSlots(from, to, name)` -> `{from, to, today, now, slots[], mine[], speakers[], version}`; each slot
     `{id, line, date 'yyyy-MM-dd', day 0-6, start/end 'HH:mm', centre, address, map, contact, places, cancelled, notes,
     people[{name, phone, by}], remaining, over, started, ended, releaseClosed}`. `mine` = every future date where the
     name is on the list or registered someone (My Registrations + cancellation notice).
   - `registerSlots(ids[], repeat, name, mobile, othersText, includeSelf, previewOnly)`; repeat = 1, 4, 8, 7, 14 or
     'all', counting the picked date. Returns `{preview, results[{id, date, start, end, centre, people[{name, self,
     status: booked|over|already|skipped, reason: cancelled|started|closed|full|clash, clash}]}], missing[], tally,
     slots[]}`. Call with previewOnly = true for the confirmation screen, then again to write.
   - `releaseSlot(id, name, personName?)`, `releaseGroup(id, name)` -> `{removed[], slot}`.
3. Stage 3: organiser menu item + dialog for the WhatsApp list (uses the private `cancellationList_` and
   `markNoticeSent_`; decide how the dialog reaches them without making them callable from the public page), and a
   setup guide for the new sheet (like `tools/build_guide.py` builds `SETUP_GUIDE.html`). First real Google check.
4. Stages 4 and 4b: demo videos (see SPEC section 5 and HANDOFF "Re-record the demo").
5. Stop and ask before any stage passes 100,000 tokens.

## 4. Map of the Follow-up files
- `followup/Code.gs`: sections in order: menu/setup/triggers; generator (`generateSlots`, `readPlan_`,
  `parsePlanLine_`, `planDates_`); reading Slots (`readTable_`, `readSlots_`, `pageSlot_`); page functions; cancellations;
  date/time helpers; helpers copied from the tour `Code.gs` (bottom of the file - keep both copies in step if one is fixed).
- `followup/Index.html`: the volunteers' page (no framework; `render()` draws calendar, list, bar from `state`; dates are
  'yyyy-MM-dd' keys and "today"/"now" come from the server, never the browser clock). Logo and font link were copied
  from the tour `Index.html` by a script (the logo is a long data address; do not read it into context).
- `docs/followup/sample-followup-sheet.xlsx`: the Follow-up sheet with MADE-UP demo data (Read me, Program plan with one
  line per frequency, Slots made by the real generator, Speakers, Update report; notes and drop-downs as live), sent to
  the user 2026-10-08 so they can return a sample copy with real data. Rebuild: `python3 tools/make_followup_sample.py`.
  Use the same demo data for the stage-4 recorder. A real copy from the user must stay out of the repository.
- `test/followup.test.js`: `setup(planLines)` builds a Program plan + empty Slots; "now" is Wed 7 Oct 2026 05:00.
- `test/followup.page.test.js`: two browser tests: (1) calendar, repeat, confirmation, release, 12-hour rule, widths
  320/390/1280; (2) register others, ✕, Release all, My registrations, cancellation notice, Telugu/Hindi + a translated
  server message. Helper `openPage(browser, gs, width, name, mobile)` opens the page with a remembered name - use it
  for new tests. `SHOT=<path>` / `SHOT2=<path>` save phone screenshots for a visual check.
- `test/harness.js`: `load(sheets, now, 'followup/Code.gs')` loads the new server; stand-ins added this session:
  `PropertiesService`, `ScriptApp` triggers (`ctx._triggers`), `getUi().alert` (`ctx._alerts`), dropdown builder,
  `deleteRow`, `insertRowsAfter`/`getMaxRows`, `Range.sort`, `setFrozenRows`, `setFontWeight`, `setNotes`.

## 5. Learnings (add new ones; keep old ones)
- 2026-10-08: **A cloud session's clone can be shallow** (`git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` = true): branch roots
  and "no common ancestor" results are then false alarms. Run `git fetch --unshallow` before comparing histories.
- 2026-10-08: **The Follow-up page is not a copy of the tour page.** A feature added to the tour `Index.html` (call
  buttons, Details) does not reach `followup/Index.html` by merging; carry it over by hand and test both pages.
- 2026-10-08: **Optional columns are matched by title and skipped silently when missing** (`readTable_`). A sheet made
  from an older sample (Slots titled Start/End/Centre/Contact/Places, no Principal Contact) loses those details on
  every card with no error. Ask for the live sheet's title rows when the page shows less than expected.
**Working with this user**
- Plain language, no unexplained abbreviations, state confidence, small changes, commit and push as you go.
- Budget: 100,000 tokens per stage. Tell the user and get approval before going over (done this session with a
  multiple-choice question; they approved up to 125,000). Report the count at the end.
- Measure tokens from the "total_tokens left" counter (low-moderate confidence in how it works): it was back at
  15,000,000 at the start of each new user message. On the first message of a session its first step dropped about
  69,000 (instructions and tools being read for the first time), which is start-up, not task work; later messages only
  count new work. Report task tokens as the counter's drop, minus that start-up on a session's first message.
- **Long design thinking is the biggest cost**: about 40,000 tokens went on working out stage 1's design in one go.
  Next time write decisions straight into a plan file in short steps, and read only the parts of big files you need
  (`Code.gs` 35 KB, `HANDOFF.md` 30 KB, `Index.html` 100 KB - never read `Index.html` whole).
- Stage 1 actual: about 117,000 task tokens against an estimate of 40,000-60,000 (spec). Treat the remaining
  stage estimates in SPEC section 5 as low by up to 2 times.

**Design facts settled this session**
- The mock-up counts the picked date in a repeat: "next 4 dates" = the picked date + 3 more.
- Slots rows are found by Slot ID (`P3-20261017`; hand-typed rows get `X-20261017-1830`), never by row number, so
  the generator may sort and delete rows.
- Plan changes are detected by remembering each line's settings in script properties (`line:P3`); an unchanged line
  only gets missing dates added, so organisers' edits to single dates survive. A cleared Line ID gets its old ID back
  when the settings match.

**Google Apps Script (moderate confidence, not yet checked on real Google)**
- Writing the strings '2026-10-17' and '18:30' with `setValues` should turn into a real date and time (like typing).
- Time-only cells read with `getValues()` come back as 1899 dates with odd offsets in India time; read times from
  display values instead.
- A date cell must be turned into 'yyyy-MM-dd' using the **spreadsheet's** time zone, not CONFIG.TIME_ZONE. The tour
  `Code.gs` `dateKey_` uses CONFIG.TIME_ZONE (fine while the sheet is set to India time; not changed - mention if the
  user ever reports dates one day off).
- Functions whose names end in `_` cannot be called from the page (`google.script.run`) or from sheet menus. Every
  other function in the project can be called by anyone with the page link.
- Simple `onOpen` can add a menu; creating a trigger needs a menu click (authorisation), so `setUpSheet` does it.

**Testing**
- In "Register others" text, a digit at the end of a name merges with the phone ("P1 9000000001" is read as an
  11-digit number). Use letters in test names.
- `Infinity % 1` is `NaN`: the "whole program" repeat was rejected until the check allowed Infinity (caught by a test).
- The tests use the harness clock in UTC and treat it as India time; write fixture dates as 'yyyy-MM-dd' strings.
- The harness clock is frozen (`new Date()` is always "now"), so anything keyed on the current time never changes in
  tests. The cache refresh used a time stamp and served stale dates in the browser test; it now uses a counter
  (also safer on real Google). Prefer counters over time stamps for "something changed" markers.
- Count test expectations by hand carefully (the week total was 6, not 9): when a browser test fails, print the page
  text at that step before changing code.
- Card grid `minmax(min(340px, 100%), 1fr)` gives 3 columns at 1280 px, 2 on tablets, 1 on phones, and never overflows
  a 320 px phone; plain `minmax(300px, 1fr)` gave 4 columns on a laptop.

- Reuse the tour tests' steps (the user's request 2026-10-08): copying their flow and assertion style for "register
  others" and "language switch" made the 2b test quick to write. Same for wording: the tour page's Telugu/Hindi for
  shared phrases was pulled out of its `TEXT` table by a script, so both pages say the same thing.
- Playwright `check()` re-finds its element after the click: a locator like "the input in Meena's row" breaks once the
  page adds a mobile box to that row; target `input[type=checkbox]`.
- Ticked speakers stay chosen after a booking (the group can book more dates); tests that book again must count them.

- The user may send new requests mid-turn (2026-10-08: "reuse tour tests", "move the Who button to the top"): fold
  them into the current stage, test them, and list them in the summary.
- Organiser-only actions: put them behind a sheet menu item that asks with `ui.alert(..., ButtonSet.YES_NO)` and
  returns nothing; never a public function that writes or returns personal data without needing the sheet's menu.
- Counting words in generated HTML counts instructions too ("Open WhatsApp" appeared in the tip text): count the
  actual elements (links) instead.
- Guide templates: `tools/followup_guide_template.html` reuses the tour guide's head/style/Copy-button script
  (assembled once by a script); `tools/build_guide.py` builds both guides; a browser test checks the Copy boxes equal the files.

- Two setup guides look alike: on the first real set-up the user pasted the tour's Code.gs into the Follow-up project (no
  Program menu). Give each guide an unmistakable check (a quoted line 2 / title line) and say what the wrong file looks like.
- Check how the code treats input it doesn't expect, not only valid input: lists in one-value columns were silently cut
  to their first value with nothing in the Update report (found 2026-10-08 by trying them). Refuse loudly instead.
- Files the user uploads may hold real phone numbers: copy them into their own scratch folder, read with `python3 -I`,
  take only the structure (column titles), and never commit their data. Keep made-up data in the repository sample.
- When a full test run fails a test that passes alone and whose files are untouched, run the full suite a few more
  times, record the rate, and raise it (suggested task) rather than calling it a flake and moving on.

- Browser-test race (fixed 2026-10-08): the tour "demo video button" test waited for the video's address to change to
  the second copy, then at once checked that Chromium had requested it. Setting the address and sending the request
  are separate steps, so under load (several browsers in parallel) the check ran in between. Wait for the event the
  check is about (here: a promise resolved inside the route handler, bounded at 8 s), not for something that only
  precedes it. Catch the real failure message first (loop the full suite until it fails), then prove the fix with
  several full runs in a row (10 here; 5 alone could pass by luck about 1 time in 10 at the old failure rate).

- Recording: `tools/` must use playwright-core 1.63.0 (pinned in tools/package.json) because the machine's video
  encoder is ffmpeg-1011; npm's latest wanted 1013 and recording failed. Voice set-up is re-downloaded per container
  (English/Hindi models ~0.5 GB, Telugu venv 7.1 GB in the scratchpad, about 10 minutes in the background).
- A saved speaker's mobile is filled in when their name is entered; a script (or a person) typing the number again
  makes it too long. The recorder clears the box first. (Page behaviour unchanged; same as the tour page.)
- Check video frames in each language: the Telugu month heading looked unjoined because the serif heading font had no
  Telugu fallback; adding the Noto fonts to the heading font list fixed it.

- Demo flows carry state between steps: "Register others" stayed ticked from the group step, so the Ongoing step booked
  three backups (two in red). Reset such toggles at the start of a step. A CSS display rule overrides the `hidden`
  attribute (`#modal{display:flex}` stayed visible and blocked clicks): add `[hidden]{display:none}` for such elements.
- Laptop sheet views: keep every shown column on screen (smaller font, wrapping titles), or the cursor's scroll hides
  the ID columns.

**Stage 4b cost** about 25,000 tokens; **4c** about 35,000. **Stage 4a cost** about 85,000 tokens. **Stage 3 cost** about 40,000 tokens. **Stage 2b cost** about 65,000 tokens. **Stage 2a cost** about 60,000 tokens (estimate for all of stage 2: 60,000-85,000), helped by reading only the needed
parts of the tour `Index.html` with grep/sed and writing the page in one pass from the agreed mock-up.
