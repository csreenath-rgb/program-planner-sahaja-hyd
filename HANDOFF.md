# Handoff / status

_Last updated: 2026-10-08 (tour 2026-10-07.1 merged into main at the user's request; the user reports the older tour items done; Follow-up stages 1-3 and 4a built on branch claude/vibrant-planck-gsxjay)_

## Start here (for a new session)
- **Read `resume.md` first**: current state, what waits on the user, next steps and lessons learned (2026-10-07).
- **What this is:** a Google Apps Script web page for the "Hyderabad 2026 - Self Realization Tour" sheet.
  Volunteers pick a date, see each school as a card (phones/tablets) or a table (laptops), and Claim /
  Release places; the speaker cell of the day tab is updated. Details of every feature: the dated log below.
- **Live:** the organiser's own Apps Script deployment of `Code.gs` + `Index.html` (paste from
  `SETUP_GUIDE.html`, then Deploy -> Manage deployments -> New version). The page footer shows the version.
  Latest pushed: 2026-10-07.1 on branch claude/zealous-johnson-h19h6w (restarted from main after pull request 3 was
  merged). 2026-10-06.4 (Ongoing Programs) is in main; neither is deployed yet.
  Live (confirmed by the user 2026-10-01 16:47): 2026-10-01.4. Ask the user which version is
  live before assuming.
- **Demo videos:** `docs/demo.mp4` (English, 75 s, phone screen, Indian English female voice), `docs/demo-te.mp4`
  (Telugu, 78 s) and `docs/demo-hi.mp4` (Hindi, 84 s). The demo button plays the one for the page's language
  (`DEMO_VIDEO_URLS.en/.te/.hi` in Index.html), each opening the organiser's Google Drive copy: English
  1L1A_FmlOukDZMTnOXa73RlzQfdaHS9Zg, Telugu 1ut0WKW9gVrnG0qRQltc7qC3P2O5GCybq, Hindi 1Hf3clK7tYRimgm3ispbHwCw4RvTKPJIM.
  The user replaces a Drive file via Drive -> Manage versions after every re-record (the link stays the same).
  The GitHub copies after each Drive link are only used if that Drive link is removed.
- **Tests:** `cd test && npm install && npm test` (90 tests: 77 tour page + 10 Follow-up server + 3 Follow-up page/guide; the tour "demo video button" test race was fixed 2026-10-08; browser tests need Chromium at
  `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`). Rebuild the guides after any code change: `python3 tools/build_guide.py` (builds `SETUP_GUIDE.html` and `followup/SETUP_GUIDE.html`).
  Bump `VERSION` in `Code.gs` (and the matching string in `test/code.test.js`) for every page change.
- **Re-record the demo:** in `tools/`: `npm i playwright-core ffmpeg-static @fontsource/dm-sans
  @fontsource/instrument-serif @fontsource/noto-sans-telugu @fontsource/noto-sans-devanagari`; voice lines
  are in `tools/voiceover/lines.json` (make_voice.py needs `pip install sherpa-onnx soundfile` and the
  kokoro-multi-lang-v1_0 model from github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/releases, tag tts-models, untarred into
  tools/voiceover/); then `node record_demo.js` and `cd voiceover && python3 mix.py <ffmpeg path>`.
  Telugu/Hindi: spoken lines in `tools/voiceover/te|hi/lines.json`, captions/cards in the `T` table of
  `record_demo.js`; `node record_demo.js te` then `python3 mix.py <ffmpeg path> te` (same for hi). Hindi voice:
  `make_voice_hi.py` (sherpa-onnx + vits-piper-hi_IN-priyamvada-medium untarred into tools/voiceover/). Telugu voice:
  `make_voice_te.py` (see its header: AI4Bharat te.zip unzipped as tools/voiceover/indic-tts-te/, Coqui TTS 0.22.0
  in a fresh virtual environment because the system Python packaging tools fail to build it; download.pytorch.org
  is blocked, so it pulls the full PyTorch from PyPI, ~7 GB installed). The model files are loaded in PyTorch's
  safe mode only (the auto-mode safety check refuses the unsafe mode, and safe mode works).
  After committing a video, re-pin that language's two GitHub URLs in `DEMO_VIDEO_URLS` (Index.html) to that commit.
  **Follow-up videos** (2026-10-08): `cd tools && npm i` (package.json pins playwright-core 1.63.0, which matches the
  installed video encoder /opt/pw-browsers/ffmpeg-1011; newer versions fail with "ffmpeg-1013 doesn't exist"); voices:
  `cd voiceover && python3 make_voice.py followup/ && python3 make_voice_hi.py followup/ && <venv>/bin/python make_voice_te.py followup/`;
  then per language `node record_followup_demo.js en|te|hi` and `python3 mix.py ../node_modules/ffmpeg-static/ffmpeg en|te|hi followup`
  -> `docs/followup/demo[-te|-hi].mp4`. Captions come from `docs/followup/demo-script.md`; demo data (the user's sample,
  phone numbers replaced) is inside `tools/record_followup_demo.js`. Re-pin `DEMO_VIDEO_URLS` in `followup/Index.html`.
- **Not in the repository on purpose:** the real sheet data (volunteers' phone numbers). Ask the user for
  an .xlsx export or screenshots when a question depends on the real layout.
- **User preferences:** plain language, no unexplained abbreviations, state confidence, keep changes small,
  report token use against their budget (100,000 per task).

## Done
- `Code.gs` + `Index.html`: Apps Script web app that opens today's tab (named like `28-Sep`)
  of the sheet it is attached to (no sheet ID in the code), shows all columns, and lets
  volunteers claim open rows (empty cell under the header containing "speaker" + "name") by
  writing "name<newline>mobile" into that cell only; no other column is ever written. Release
  allowed only by the same name (first line of the cell).
- Concurrency: `LockService` script lock + re-check inside the lock; row fingerprint rejects
  claims on rows that were edited/moved since page load; 5-second shared `CacheService` read cache.
- 13 tests green (12 logic tests against a simulated Apps Script + 1 two-user browser test).
- `README.md`: step-by-step setup guide for the sheet editor.
- `SETUP_GUIDE.html`: one-stop guide (all steps + both code files with Copy buttons), generated by
  `tools/build_guide.py` from `tools/guide_template.html` + the real code files. Rebuild after any code change.

- 2026-09-29: multi-slot schools. Optional column whose header contains "slot" gives each row's
  capacity (blank/missing = 1, 0 = closed). The speaker cell lists everyone, one per line
  ("Name mobile"); a person ends at the line holding their phone, and a blank line separates an
  entry with no phone. Page adds "Slots left" + "Assigned" (name · phone) columns.
- 2026-09-29: matched the real 30-Sep titles: capacity = header with "total"+"volunteer"
  ("Total volunteers needed"); the page keeps "count of Volunteers still neeeded" ("still"+"volunteer")
  up to date on claim/release (skipped if it holds a formula) and leaves it out of the row
  fingerprint so concurrent joiners aren't refused. Verified against the real 30-Sep/01-Oct data
  from an .xlsx export (not committed: contains phone numbers). 27 tests.

- 2026-09-29: decided to keep claiming open to anyone with the link (name + mobile typed on the
  page). Restricting to names on the sheet's "Speaker" tab was offered and declined.

- 2026-09-29: date picker + time clashes. Day tabs = names like '30-Sep' (current year), today and
  later only, sorted; page opens on today (or next). getState/claimRow/releaseRow take the tab name.
  Start time parsed from free-text Time column(s) (first non-empty if several); a person can't hold
  two schools with the same start time on the same tab. Checked on the real workbook: every typed
  time parses except "to be confirmed"; many 30-Sep times are blank (no clash check possible). 39 tests.

- 2026-09-29: checked the UPDATED 30-Sep tab (20 columns, pasted as text): capacity read from
  D "Total volunteers needed" (20/6/12), not F "Total No of Students"; E updated on claim; times
  '2pm to 3pm. (STRICT TIMINGS)' -> 14:00 and '3:30 to 4:30 pm - 6 sessions' -> 15:30 (S No 2 and 3
  clash for one person). Locked in as a test with fake data. 40 tests.

- 2026-09-29: http(s) addresses in any cell are rendered as links (new tab, noopener); Google Maps
  links read "Open map". Non-http text (e.g. javascript:) stays plain text. 41 tests.

- 2026-09-29: "Assigned" column lists each person on its own numbered line (name + number kept on one line, column widens) with a solid 2px divider. 41 tests.

- 2026-09-29: mobile must be exactly 10 digits (spaces/dashes ignored; leading +91, 91 or 0 accepted and
  dropped); stored as the plain 10 digits. Checked on the page before sending and again in the script. 42 tests.

- 2026-09-29: page hides the sheet's own Speaker Name column (same people shown in the page's own
  column) and that page column is titled "SY Speaker Name" (was "Assigned"). 42 tests.

- 2026-09-29: register others + over-limit. claimRow(row, fp, name, mobile, tab, othersText, includeSelf):
  others as 'Name mobile' lines -> written 'Name mobile (via Registrar)'; all-or-nothing validation
  (10-digit mobile, time clash per person, dedupe, max 30). removePerson(row, fp, requester, person, tab):
  allowed for the person or their registrar. Schools may exceed their total (row.over); extra people
  shown red "(over limit)", "Over by N"; total 0 = closed. 48 tests.

- 2026-09-29: speaker list. Tab 'Speaker'/'Speakers' (created as 'Speakers' if missing). getState returns
  speakers [{name, mobile}] sorted case-insensitively. Every person added by a claim is saved there
  (fill missing mobile for a known name; new row + next Sr. No. otherwise; 'Mobile' header added in the
  first blank header cell). Page: name datalist fills saved mobile; "Choose speakers" searchable
  multi-select; a speaker without a saved number gets a one-time mobile box. Checked on the real
  Speaker tab: 40 names, Mobile column lands in P, no other cell changed. 54 tests.

- 2026-09-29: page shows the serial column ('S No' / 'Sl No' / 'Sr. No.') first, titled "Sl.No"; the page's
  clash label reads "Clashes with Sl.No N". Script messages still use the sheet's own title. 54 tests.

- 2026-09-29: checked the user's testing workbook (30_Sep_Assignments_-_Testing_Sheet.xlsx; not committed).
  Differences vs earlier: 30-Sep serial column titled "Sl.No", columns reordered (Date G, Time H, map J,
  students K); Speaker tab now has an empty "Mobile" column C. Latest code works unchanged: capacity,
  still-needed (16/1/10 match the sheet), clash check, speaker saving into existing column C. Real use
  visible: page-format entries in 30-Sep B. Speaker tab has no page-added rows yet => the deployed page
  predates the speaker-list version. Test added for this layout. 55 tests.

- 2026-09-29: past handling. listDays_ now includes past day tabs (past:true, label "(past)"); default
  day = first non-past else latest. endTime_ parses the end after "to"/dash (else start + 1h; blank =
  never ends). markPast_ sets state.pastDay and row.past (today: now >= end, spreadsheet time zone).
  mutate_ refuses any change on a past day or ended slot. Page greys them out ("Past"/"Ended"), hides
  Register others on past days, and "Open only" hides past rows. 58 tests.

- 2026-09-29: default day = today, or the next day once every timed slot today has ended (untimed rows
  ignored; needs >= 1 timed row; stays on today if there is no later tab). state.defaultDay tells the page.
  The page no longer pins the first day shown, so an open page follows the default (e.g. past midnight)
  unless another date was picked; picking the default entry = follow it. 61 tests.
  If a deployed page opens on a fixed date, check TAB_NAME_OVERRIDE is '' in Code.gs.

- 2026-09-29: languages. Index.html has a TEXT table (en/te/hi) + t(key, ...args); static elements use
  data-t / data-tp; script error messages are matched by regex (SERVER_TEXT) and shown translated
  (unknown ones stay English). Always opens in English (not remembered). Day labels rebuilt client-side
  (weekday + today/past marks). Browser test covers te/hi switching and a translated clash message. 62 tests.
  NOT VERIFIED: Telugu/Hindi wording by a native speaker; Telugu glyph rendering (test browser lacks a
  Telugu font, so screenshots show unjoined letters; real phones should render correctly).

- 2026-09-29: user saw today (29-Sep) open instead of 30-Sep after all slots ended. Replaying the real
  29-Sep tab through the code gives 30-Sep from 18:30 IST (last slot 4:30-6:30 PM), so the cause was on the
  deployed side: an older Code.gs, or the testing sheet's time zone not being India. Fix: CONFIG.TIME_ZONE
  = 'Asia/Kolkata' (used for today/now), VERSION constant, page shows "Sheet time: … · v…". 64 tests.

- 2026-09-29: branding from Sahaja_Yoga_Proposal_Final.pptx: header with lotus logo (slide 1 image, cropped +
  resized to assets/lotus.png, embedded as data URI) and title "Hyderabad 2026 - Self Realization Tour" /
  "Schedule & Assignments" (translated te/hi, needs review); fonts DM Sans + Instrument Serif (+ Noto
  Telugu/Devanagari) via Google Fonts; deck colours. VERSION 2026-09-29.5. 64 tests. Real fonts not seen
  in test screenshots (Google Fonts blocked in the build sandbox).

- 2026-09-29: docs/demo.mp4 (49 s, 1280x720, H.264): the real Index.html + Code.gs logic on a demo copy of the
  30-Sep layout (real school names/times/map links, made-up volunteers), with captions, a cursor and a live
  sheet panel. Not recorded from the deployed page (Google blocked in the build sandbox). tools/record_demo.js.

- 2026-09-29: gold "Watch the 1-minute demo" button in the header (full width on phones) opens a pop-up
  <video playsinline> player; sources DEMO_VIDEO_URLS = jsDelivr + raw.githubusercontent pinned to commit
  c80e7a2 (tries the next on error; "Open the video" link fallback; a Drive link opens Drive's player).
  NOT VERIFIED from the sandbox: jsDelivr/GitHub delivery to real phones (both hosts blocked here). VERSION .6. 65 tests.

- 2026-09-29: Indian English female voice-over added to docs/demo.mp4 (now 58 s; each step waits for its line).
  Voice = Kokoro "hf_alpha" (speaker 31, speed 0.95) run offline via sherpa-onnx; lines, clips, timing marks and
  scripts in tools/voiceover/ (make_voice.py speaks, mix.py mixes; peak -1.7 dB). Video commit 7d78113.
  DEMO_VIDEO_URLS now starts with the organisers' Google Drive link (1L1A_FmlOukDZMTnOXa73RlzQfdaHS9Zg), so the
  button opens Drive's player in a new tab; GitHub copies re-pinned to 7d78113 as the no-Drive fallback.
  VERSION .7. 65 tests. NOT VERIFIED: nobody has listened to the voice yet (the build machine can't play audio);
  the Drive file must be replaced with the voiced video via Manage versions (it still holds the silent one).

- 2026-09-30: adaptive layout (Index.html styles + render()). Phones and tablets (<=1100px wide) show each school as a
  card: Sl.No + school name, time, slots-left badge + Claim/Release, speakers, then Address and Google map as
  label: value lines. Hidden in cards (duplicates of the badge / chosen date): "Total volunteers needed", "still
  needed", "Date". Phones (<=700px) put the other columns (contacts, remarks...) behind a "Details" tap that stays
  open across the 15-second refresh; tablets show them all, two per line. Laptops (>1100px) keep the full table
  with Sl.No, button and Slots left frozen while it scrolls sideways (pinColumns, re-measured by a ResizeObserver
  after fonts load). Cell kinds come from header words (institution/school, time, address, map/location).
  Table now border-collapse:separate (needed for clean frozen columns). VERSION 2026-09-30.1. 66 tests.
  NOT VERIFIED on real phones/tablets (only Chromium at 390 / 820 / 1150 / 1280 pixels wide); Telugu/Hindi
  "Details" wording needs a native speaker's check.

- 2026-09-30: demo re-recorded on a phone screen (390 px frame beside the sheet panel) to show the card layout:
  new step 2 "Each school is a card. Tap Details..." (voice line "cards"), "row" -> "card" in step 3, intro says
  "in about a minute". 74 s, peak -1.9 dB. Video commit c404ead; GitHub fallback links in Index.html re-pinned to
  it. VERSION 2026-09-30.2. Drive copy must be replaced again via Manage versions. Voice not listened to by a human.

- 2026-09-30: "My Registrations" section (Index.html render): schools where the typed name is on the row, or
  where that name registered someone ("via"), are drawn in a separate table #mine above "All Schools" (#grid);
  never in both. After Claim the page scrolls to the card there, outlines it in gold and says so. "Open only"
  now hides every full or ended school from All Schools (earlier it kept your own full ones, which looked like a
  bug); your own always stay under My Registrations. Chosen day only. Both tables share the card/frozen-column
  styles (table.grid). Tests now find schools by sheet row (tr[data-row]). VERSION 2026-09-30.3. 67 tests.
  Known limit: matching is by typed name, so a different spelling won't show in My Registrations.

- 2026-09-30: demo re-recorded for My Registrations (step 3 caption + voice line s2 mention the card moving up).
  Video commit d7ad93f; GitHub fallback links re-pinned. VERSION 2026-09-30.4. Drive copy must be replaced again.

- 2026-09-30: speed. (1) doGet puts the first day's state into the page (placeholder `/*INITIAL_STATE*/null` in
  Index.html, `<` escaped), so the first view needs no second server trip; falls back to asking if that fails.
  (2) Shared cache 5 s -> 30 s (user asked to stay close to 5 s), cleared at once on claim/release and by a new
  simple `onEdit` trigger when someone types in the sheet; a changed sheet size (rows/columns inserted or
  deleted) also forces a fresh read. (3) Days already viewed show at once when picked again, then refresh.
  (4) Fonts no longer hold up drawing. (5) "Loading schools…" with a spinner whenever nothing can be shown yet;
  footer shows "loaded in N s". VERSION 2026-09-30.5. 70 tests.
  NOT VERIFIED on real Google: that the simple onEdit trigger may use CacheService (if not, typed edits show
  within 30 s instead of at once); real load times (read the footer on a phone before/after).

- 2026-10-01: for elderly users, everything above the school list is larger: labels, boxes, dropdowns and the
  speaker list at 18px, tick boxes 22px, status 18px, notes 16px, footer 14px. The "Day: 30-Sep" heading
  (repeated the Date picker) is hidden from view but kept for screen readers (h2#title, visually-hidden style).
  VERSION 2026-09-30.6. 70 tests.

- 2026-10-01: English button "Claim" -> "Register" ("Register (full)" when full); past-day note and busy message
  say "register" too (busy-message matcher accepts both old and new server text). Telugu/Hindi buttons left as
  they were (user's choice). VERSION 2026-10-01.1. 70 tests.

- 2026-10-01: demo re-recorded with the latest page (Register button, larger controls, no Day heading); voice
  lines s2/s5/end and captions say "Register". 75 s. Video commit 88208f6; GitHub fallback links re-pinned.
  VERSION 2026-10-01.2. Drive copy must be replaced via Manage versions.

- 2026-10-01: Telugu and Hindi demo videos. Wording drafted, shown to the user and approved (review sheet with English
  back-translations: `tools/voiceover/telugu-hindi-draft.md`). At the user's choice the Telugu/Hindi "Register" button
  now reads నమోదు చేయండి / पंजीकरण करें (was ఎంచుకోండి / चुनें, "Choose"), matching "Register others" / "My
  Registrations". Recorded with the page in that language from the start; last step says "Want English or
  Hindi/Telugu?" and switches through them. Telugu clips: pauses cut to 0.45 s, loudness raised to match Hindi.
  Videos at commit 081cbcd; demo button picks the video by page language (English still opens Drive). Every frame
  checked by eye (Telugu letters join correctly with the real font). English recording re-run as a check, unchanged
  (not re-committed). VERSION 2026-10-01.3. 70 tests (the demo button test now covers Telugu/Hindi and was checked
  to fail when the page ignores the language).
  NOT VERIFIED: nobody has listened to the Telugu or Hindi voices (the build machine can't play audio); wording not
  checked by a native speaker; GitHub delivery of the videos to real phones.

- 2026-10-01: Telugu and Hindi Drive links from the user put first in `DEMO_VIDEO_URLS.te` / `.hi`, so every language
  now opens its own video in Drive's player. Demo button test rewritten: as shipped, each language opens its own
  Drive link (and back to English); with all Drive links removed, each language plays its own GitHub copy in the page
  (checked to fail when the page ignores the language). VERSION 2026-10-01.4. 70 tests. Branch merged into main
  with a normal merge (keeps the pinned video commit 081cbcd reachable).
  NOT VERIFIED: that the two Drive files are shared as "Anyone with the link" (Google is blocked from the sandbox).

- 2026-10-01: user deployed 2026-10-01.4 (footer confirms it on a computer and a phone). First real load times from
  the footer: computer 2.3 s, phone 2.4 s. No earlier number exists to compare with. The timer runs from when the
  page's own frame starts loading until the schools are drawn, so Google's own start-up before that is not counted.
  Nearly equal times on both devices suggest the wait is mostly network/Google, not the device.
  User confirmed the demo button opens the right Drive video in English, Telugu and Hindi on computer and phone.
  User sees "Loading schools…" with the spinner on a fresh open. NOT conclusive: that box is in the page's starting
  HTML and fonts don't block drawing, so it can show for a moment before the script runs even when the built-in
  first-day data works. Only a spinner lasting about a second or more would mean that data is missing.

- 2026-10-06: test run in a fresh container: 69 of 70 pass. The one failure is test 68 (adaptive layout), check
  "Sl.No, button and Slots left stay put": on the laptop table the third frozen column moves 1 pixel (171 -> 170)
  when the table scrolls sideways. No code has changed since 70/70 (only documents since commit 4551774), so it comes
  from this container's font sizes giving a column a fraction-of-a-pixel width: pinTable adds up whole-pixel widths
  (`offsetWidth`). Cosmetic. Proposed fix (not applied, waits for the go-ahead): use the exact width
  (`getBoundingClientRect().width`). Confidence moderate-high.
- 2026-10-06: feature brief "Ongoing Programs" received with a new workbook (30_Sep_Assignments_-_Testing_SheetNew.xlsx,
  not committed) whose new "Ongoing" tab has the backup, frequency and days columns but no start/end date columns.
  Questions, options and the recommended design: `docs/ongoing-programs-design.md`. Waiting for the user's answers
  and go-ahead; build proposed as two tasks (server, then page), each under 100,000 tokens.

- 2026-10-06: Ongoing Programs, phase 1 (server) DONE, page not yet. User chose option A with all recommended answers
  (docs/ongoing-programs-design.md section 3), plus: ended programs are never open for sign-up. Code.gs: the tab named
  "Ongoing" is listed after the dates (`ongoing: true`); the page opens on it once every date is past. On that tab only:
  backup column (header "backup"+"name"), its total ("backup"+"needed", blank = 1, 0 = none) and still-needed
  ("backup"+"still", kept up to date), Start/End Date (read as real dates, or day-first text), Days of the Week
  ("Mon, Thu", "Mon to Fri"; none named = every day). claimRow/releaseRow/removePerson take an optional last input
  role ('backup'; left out = primary, so old open pages still work). Refused: both roles for one person on one program;
  an ended program (end date passed, or end date today and its time over). Clash on Ongoing = same start time + shared
  weekday + both still running, counting both roles. Date tabs unchanged. Fingerprint leaves out all four written
  cells. Real 2026-10-06 workbook replayed: 3 programs read correctly (its date cells are still blank = no limit).
  VERSION 2026-10-06.1. 62 server tests (new ones checked to fail when the clash, fingerprint or ended rule is broken).

- 2026-10-06: Ongoing Programs, phase 2 (page) DONE. Index.html: "Ongoing programs" entry in the date list (en/te/hi);
  on that tab each card shows a dates line ("8 Oct 2026 to 29 Oct 2026 · Weekly · Wed", month names translated), then
  a Primary block (places left, Register/Release, names) and a Backup block (the same), then address/map/Details; the
  sheet's backup, frequency, days and date columns are hidden on cards (shown raw on laptops, like other duplicates).
  Laptop table: columns Primary | Primary slots left | Primary volunteers | Backup | Backup slots left | Backup
  volunteers | Dates & days. Holding one role hides the other role's Register (registering others still shows it).
  Page clash label uses the script's rule (shared weekday + both running). My Registrations and "Open only" count both
  roles. Four new script messages translated. Frozen-column 1-pixel fix: exact widths (getBoundingClientRect) instead
  of whole pixels; that test now checks within 0.01 pixel. README and the guide's organiser rules describe the
  Ongoing tab. 77 tests (1 new browser test). Screenshots checked by eye at 390 and 1280 pixels wide (two layout
  fixes made after looking: a divider so the Backup block never shares the Primary line; headed button columns).
  Real workbook (700388ce upload, dates filled in) replayed: 8-29 Oct Wed 9.30, 22 Oct-10 Dec Tue/Thu 4-5pm,
  from 9 Oct Mon-Fri 3-4pm all read correctly; the 10 Dec program closes at 5 pm that day.
  NOT VERIFIED: on real Google (dates are read with getValues, which the build machine can't call for real; the test
  stand-in returns dates the way Google documents it); Telugu/Hindi wording of the new phrases by a native speaker.
- 2026-10-06: user found the two-block Ongoing cards cluttered and chose option B of three (A two buttons, B one
  Register that asks the role, C a page-wide role switch). Index.html: an Ongoing card has the same three cells as a
  date-tab card: one badge "Primary 2 of 2 · Backup 1 of 2" (each count kept on one line), one names list (primary
  first, backups with a grey "Backup" tag, over-limit red per role), one button cell. Register is replaced by "Register
  as: [Primary] [Backup] [Cancel]" ("Register 3 people as:" with Register others; a full role reads "Backup (full)" in
  amber); skipped when only one role has places; the question stays open across the 15-second refresh (askRow) and is
  only shown once your name/mobile/others list are valid. Success message names the role ("Registered 2 people as
  Backup."). Release and ✕ need no question. Laptop columns: Sl.No | button | Slots left | Volunteers | Dates & days.
  White buttons (Release, Cancel) now get a light tint on hover instead of dark blue, which hid their text (phones
  keep the hover look after a tap). Date tabs unchanged (test checks headers and the "0 of 1" badge). Server unchanged.
  VERSION 2026-10-06.2. 77 tests (Ongoing browser test rewritten: question, Cancel, single-role skip, others count,
  ✕ remove, Telugu tag). Screenshots checked at 390 and 1280 pixels wide.
- 2026-10-06: at the user's request the Ongoing places badge shows the Backup count on its own line under the Primary
  count (span.roleline, display:block; no "·" between them), on phones and laptops alike. VERSION 2026-10-06.3.
  77 tests (the Ongoing browser test checks the two lines and that Backup sits lower).
- 2026-10-06: at the user's request the "Backup" tag next to a name is solid gold (var(--gold)) with bold navy text
  (contrast about 5.1:1, above the 4.5:1 guideline for small text), everywhere a backup is listed; ended programs
  still grey it out (their existing !important grey rule). Gold was chosen because red and amber already mean
  "over limit" / "full". Also moved a CSS comment that an earlier edit had separated from its rule. VERSION
  2026-10-06.4. 77 tests (the Ongoing browser test checks the tag's colours and boldness).
- 2026-10-06: pull request 3 (Ongoing programs, 2026-10-06.4) created and merged into main at the user's request (merge
  commit). Deleting the two merged branches (claude/optimistic-ritchie-os2avr, claude/zealous-johnson-h19h6w) failed
  from the session (GitHub 403: the session may only push to its own branch); the user was given the "Delete branch"
  buttons on pull requests 2 and 3 and the "Automatically delete head branches" setting.
- 2026-10-07: "still needed" counts kept correct automatically (user chose option 1 of 3: app keeps them / sheet
  formulas / a recalculate menu). Code.gs syncRemaining_: every "still needed" cell (primary on all tabs; backups on
  Ongoing) is made equal to places left, i.e. what the page shows. Runs (a) on every fresh read of today's, a later
  day's or the Ongoing tab (cachedState_ with keepCounts; past days are left as a record), (b) from onEdit whenever
  someone types in such a tab (names, totals, or a number typed over the count, which the user accepted is replaced),
  (c) on registrations as before. Only differing cells are written, formula cells are skipped, and writes happen inside
  the script lock after a re-read (skipped if the lock is busy; the next read catches up). 2 new server tests (checked
  to fail with the read or the edit path switched off).
  Phones only (700 pixels wide or less): each volunteer's number is replaced by a round call button (34 pixels, tel:
  link with +91, target _top because the page runs in Google's frame, label "Call <name>" in en/te/hi). Tablets and
  laptops still show the number. The page text is unchanged for tests (number kept in a hidden span on phones).
  VERSION 2026-10-07.1. 79 tests. Phone screenshot checked.
  NOT VERIFIED on real Google: that the simple onEdit trigger may write to the sheet and use LockService (Google
  documents simple triggers can edit the bound sheet; if not, the counts still update on the next page read);
  that a tel: link opens the dial pad from inside Google's frame on Android and iPhone (moderate confidence).

## Not yet done / not verified
- Never run on real Google Apps Script or against the live sheet (build machine had no access
  to docs.google.com). First real check = README Step 5.
- Must be deployed by someone with EDIT access (the requester has View only).
- 2026-09-27: user's live test on a copy got as far as `getState` → found the `27-Sep` tab but the
  header differed ("Sahaja Yoga ( IND) Speaker Name", no mobile column) → fixed with word-based
  header matching.
- 2026-09-27: LIVE TEST PASSED on the user's own copy of the sheet (deployed web app):
  page load on 27-Sep, claim, release, two-device race, sheet→page refresh all confirmed.
- 2026-09-27: checked 28/29/30-Sep screenshots. 28-Sep's "Speaker Mobile" column C actually holds
  local contacts, so writing the mobile there could overwrite them → claims now write only the
  speaker cell on every tab.
- 1-Oct tab not seen yet; must be named `1-Oct` or `01-Oct`. Other future tabs may differ;
  if not, the page errors loudly rather than guessing.

## Next step
- **2026-10-08: calendar starts today and shows 7 days (user: "start the days in the calendar view from today and show
  the next 7 days instead of adding another week"; "no need of mockup ... go ahead").** `followup/Index.html`: the
  calendar's first day is today (was Monday of this week), so no greyed past days; the 8th box "These 7 days: N open"
  (en/te/hi: "These 7 days" / "ఈ 7 రోజుల్లో" / "इन 7 दिनों में" - native check wanted); ‹ › move 7 days (labels "Previous/
  Next 7 days" in en/te/hi); ‹ disabled on the first 7 days. `monday()` removed (no longer used). VERSION
  followup-2026-10-08.8. SPEC.md row 1 notes the change. Page tests updated (Wed 7 Oct: Today..Tue 13, total 8, no past
  box, ‹ enabled after ›). 93 tests pass; phone screenshot checked. The two-week mock-up
  (`docs/followup/mockup-two-weeks/`) is dropped (kept for the record). The demo videos still show the old Monday-start
  week, and `tools/record_followup_demo.js` taps `[data-date="2026-10-17"]` after ‹ ›: check it before re-recording.
- **2026-10-08: user: the Follow-up page's demo button plays the TOUR videos.** Checked every version of
  `followup/Index.html`: it has only ever pointed at the Follow-up videos (Drive en 1XshvyqAgaCgKGTKlMG_DQt3YVApHH7Gi,
  te 12YBe_afPiP3vGaH2egcwJ3J7hp9M1bxu, hi 1bkxi19Gq8C4MmXqxVxn8To653AQxBoLH, the user's links; GitHub copies of
  `docs/followup/demo*.mp4`), never at the tour's (Drive 1L1A_Fml..., 1ut0WKW9..., 1Hf3clK7...). So the three Drive
  files most likely hold the tour videos: both sets share the file names demo.mp4 / demo-te.mp4 / demo-hi.mp4 (tour in
  `docs/`, Follow-up in `docs/followup/`). Could not open Drive from the session (network policy: drive.google.com and
  drive.usercontent.google.com denied, 403). Asked the user to check each Drive link (tour video = "Hyderabad 2026 -
  Self Realization Tour" at the top; Follow-up = "Follow-up Program" + day boxes) and upload `docs/followup/demo*.mp4`
  as a new version of each (Manage versions keeps the links; no code change), and to check the three tour Drive files
  still hold the new tour videos (step 7 "Ongoing programs"). Not done, for the next code change: the Follow-up page's
  GitHub fallback copies still point at MamtaMukeshK/task-self-assign-sahaja-hyd@becaae3 (they work; re-pin to the fork
  like the tour page).
- **2026-10-08: second week in the calendar: MOCK-UP ONLY, waiting for the user's go.** User: "add another week which looks
  same as current week but below it", then "show me the mockup before starting work on it". Mock-up (scratch copy of the
  page, real page unchanged): `docs/followup/mockup-two-weeks/` (`mock.js` re-renders `mock-phone.png`, `mock-laptop.png`;
  its `renderCalendar` is the draft to build from). Each week gets a small heading ("This week · 5 Oct – 11 Oct", "Next
  week · …", later "Week of 19 Oct") and its own "N open" box. Open questions put to the user: arrows step 2 weeks
  (recommended) or 1; keep the headings; the calendar is about twice as tall on phones; demo videos would still show one
  week (re-record or not). Estimate to build: 15,000-25,000 tokens without videos (low-moderate confidence).
- **2026-10-08: live sheet checked (user sent a copy, kept out of the repository; phone numbers not copied anywhere).**
  Program plan titles = the script's titles exactly (nothing to change). Slots tab = the older sample's (Start, End,
  Centre, Contact, Places; no Principal Contact): cause of no principal on any card, and of every booked date being
  flagged 'Principal Contact is ""' in the Update report. **Fixed in followup-2026-10-08.7 (commit 40dbd2a):** the
  generator ("Update slots now" and the Sunday run) first brings both tabs' titles up to date (`upgradeColumns_`): older
  titles renamed, a missing optional column inserted after its neighbour (format set, drop-down cleared or set), then
  the added Slots details columns (Institution Name, Address, Map, Principal/Sahaji Contact) are filled in from the plan
  for today and later dates (booked ones too; past dates left as a record). The pop-up and the Update report say what
  changed. Required columns are never added (a missing one is still a clear error). Also: volunteers' names and numbers
  bold, "(via …)" grey, as on the tour page. Tests: server tests find columns by title now (old-title sheets get
  renamed); new test 11 reproduces the live sheet (checked to fail with the fix off). 93 tests pass.
  Still for the user: booked dates of P1 (10/17/24/31 Oct) and P3 (12 Oct) keep their old Sahaji Contact (Lakshmi /
  Suresh; plan says Padma), by the agreed rule that booked dates are never changed automatically: change by hand if
  Padma is right. Asked whether contact-only changes should update booked dates automatically (not built).
- **2026-10-08: Follow-up page: call buttons and Details like the tour page (version followup-2026-10-08.6, commit 464fdb3).**
  User (first real set-up): no Details button and volunteers' numbers not turned into call buttons. Phones (700 pixels
  or less): each volunteer's number is now a round call button (same code as tour v2026-10-07.1: `PHONE_ICON`, `telOf`,
  +91, `target="_top"`, label "Call <name>" in en/te/hi); tablets and laptops show the number. Details now holds the
  Principal contact AND the Sahaji contact (new label "Sahaji contact:" in en/te/hi - Telugu/Hindi need a native check);
  the Details button shows on phones when either is set; on tablets and laptops Details shows without a button (same as
  the tour). Tap-to-call links in Details and "release closed" now open from Google's frame (`target="_top"`). 92 tests.
- **2026-10-08: history check (user asked whether the fork lost versions).** Result: **nothing is missing.** With full
  history fetched, every commit of every branch in `MamtaMukeshK/task-self-assign-sahaja-hyd` (main,
  claude/vibrant-planck-gsxjay, claude/zealous-johnson-h19h6w, claude/optimistic-ritchie-os2avr) is inside the fork's
  `main` (0 missing each). The tour's `Code.gs`/`Index.html` differ from the original main only by the intended
  VERSION 2026-10-08.1 and the re-pinned backup video links. Why the Follow-up page lacked call buttons: it is a separate
  page, written new on 2026-10-08 02:23-02:49 on vibrant-planck-gsxjay; the tour call buttons were built 2026-10-07 on
  zealous-johnson (another branch) and reached the working branch only by the merge at 12:31 (cf1f595), which changes the
  tour files only. Nobody carried the feature over - a gap in the build, not in the fork.
  **Likely cause of missing card details (not yet confirmed with the user):** the sample the user uploaded
  (86706942-sample-followup-sheet.xlsx) has a Slots tab with the OLD titles (Start, End, Centre, Contact, Places) and NO
  "Principal Contact" column. The script matches Slots columns by title; optional ones it cannot find are skipped
  silently (`readTable_` only errors for required ones), and "Set up the sheet" never changes an existing tab. So a live
  sheet made from that file shows no principal contacts on any card. Asked the user for the live Slots title row and a
  phone screenshot. Proposed (not built, needs the user's go): name missing columns in "Update slots now" and the Update
  report; fill blank info cells of future dates from the plan line. Other tour-card differences: the tour shows every
  sheet column (extra ones behind Details, with the column title as label) and a serial number; the Follow-up card
  shows a fixed set (time, places, institution, address, map, notes, Details, volunteers).
- **2026-10-08: first real set-up: no "Program" menu after reload** (user). Code checked: standard onOpen, file loads
  cleanly. Guide Part 5 now has a fallback box: run setUpSheet / onOpen from the Apps Script tab, one Google account per
  window, check Executions for onOpen. **Cause found:** the user's Code.gs ended with `function cacheKey_` = the tour page's
  Code.gs (from the other guide), which has no onOpen. Guide Parts 3/4 now say how to tell the two files apart (line 2 of
  Code.gs, line 6 of Index.html, last line `function norm_`).
- **2026-10-08: real names.** The new Google Sheet is "HYD-SY Follow-up Programs" and its Apps Script project "Follow-ups
  Planner" (user). Setup guide steps 1, 2 and 5 and the organiser video's sheet title use them.
- **2026-10-08: moved to the user's repository.** `csreenath-rgb/program-planner-sahaja-hyd` (the user turned the fork into
  one branch, `main`, at 6ccd54f); its `main` was fast-forwarded to 28c0bc8 (stages 4b, 4c, guide links). Continue there, on
  `main`. `MamtaMukeshK/task-self-assign-sahaja-hyd` keeps the old branch as a backup (not in that repository's main).
- **2026-10-08: stages 4b and 4c DONE (all of stage 4 recorded).** 4b: tour videos `docs/demo.mp4`, `demo-te.mp4`,
  `demo-hi.mp4` re-recorded with the Ongoing programs scene (step 7: pick Ongoing programs, Register, Backup; "Register
  others" unticked first so only Priya registers) on tour v2026-10-07.1; tour page's GitHub fallback copies re-pinned to
  the fork csreenath-rgb/program-planner-sahaja-hyd (commit 012cfc6); tour VERSION 2026-10-08.1. **Done by the user 2026-10-08: the three tour Drive files are replaced (Manage versions, same links).** 4c: `docs/followup/organiser-demo.mp4` (English, ~2 min,
  laptop screen drawn from the real tab layout, first caption says it is not live Google Sheets) by
  `tools/record_organiser_demo.js` (real followup/Code.gs underneath; user's sample, phone numbers replaced, P7 One-off);
  linked from `followup/SETUP_GUIDE.html`: the organiser's Drive copy (1Lv6ZFWNxIDeFo9KWArfxrzqFhxbEWhmx, sent 2026-10-08)
  first, the fork's GitHub copy second. Captions of 4c steps 1-8 were written by Claude (narration approved).
  Fork: csreenath-rgb/program-planner-sahaja-hyd has every branch, but this session still has no push access there
  (add_repo: "you need push access"); commits are backed up on origin's claude/vibrant-planck-gsxjay (not in main).
  Once access exists: `git push <fork> claude/vibrant-planck-gsxjay` (fast-forward from 6ccd54f).
- **2026-10-08 (later): user decisions and state.** Drive links for the three Follow-up videos are in
  `followup/Index.html`; Week of month is numbers only (1st-5th, "last" refused); Sahaji Contact confirmed; tour
  v2026-10-07.1 merged into `main` at the user's request (vibrant-planck-gsxjay is NOT merged into main: the user wants
  it kept as a separate repository; main was only merged *into* it). Fork to the user's account csreenath-rgb failed
  (this session's GitHub login is MamtaMukeshK; no rights there): the user forks it themselves and connects that account,
  then continue there. **Stage 4b in progress, paused by the user:** tour recorder has the Ongoing scene (commit 3820830),
  English voices regenerated; still to do: `python3 make_voice_hi.py`, `<venv>/bin/python make_voice_te.py` (tools/voiceover),
  record + mix en/te/hi (`node record_demo.js [te|hi]`, `python3 mix.py <ffmpeg> [te|hi]`), check frames, re-pin the tour
  `DEMO_VIDEO_URLS` GitHub copies, bump the tour VERSION (+ test/code.test.js), user replaces the three tour Drive files.
  Then 4c (organiser video). "Custom" frequency (user, 2026-10-08): meant several days/times a week; not needed, because
  each day/time is its own line. In the demo data P7 (Begumpet, 14 Nov) is entered as One-off.
- **2026-10-08: unmerged parallel work found.** Branch `claude/zealous-johnson-h19h6w` = tour v2026-10-07.1 (still-needed
  counts kept correct automatically, call buttons on phones), not in `main` or this branch. Decide with the user before
  merging; this branch never touched the tour's code files.
- **2026-10-08: Follow-up stage 4a DONE: demo videos in English, Telugu, Hindi** (`docs/followup/demo.mp4` 87 s,
  `demo-te.mp4`, `demo-hi.mp4`), recorded with `tools/record_followup_demo.js` on the user's latest sample (their names
  and sessions; every phone number replaced with a made-up one) at "Mon 12 Oct 2026, 6 AM". Steps: name and mobile,
  one-week calendar, select two sessions + "next 4 dates", Who -> Ravi Kumar, Register -> confirmation -> My
  registrations, Release one date + "Release closed" under 12 h, a cancelled date's red notice, languages. Voices set
  up again from the same sources (Telugu venv 7.1 GB in the scratchpad; not kept after the container goes). Page fix
  found while checking frames: serif headings had no Telugu/Hindi fallback (Telugu month name looked unjoined).
  Demo button now plays the GitHub copies pinned to commit becaae3. **Waiting on the user:** upload the three videos to
  Drive ("Anyone with the link") and send the links (then put them first in `DEMO_VIDEO_URLS`); say what Frequency
  "Custom" (sample line P7) should mean (today such a line is skipped and reported). **Next: 4b** (Ongoing programs
  scene in the three tour videos), then **4c** (organiser video).
- **2026-10-08: tour "demo video button" browser test made reliable (test only; no page change).** Failure caught in a
  full run: "tried the first copy, then the second" saw only the first copy's request. Cause: the test checked the
  request log right after the video's address changed, before Chromium had sent the second request (a race under the
  load of parallel browser tests). Fix in `test/page.test.js`: the route handler for the second copy resolves a
  promise and the test waits for it (at most 8 s) before the same check. Full suite then passed 10 runs in a row (90 tests).
- **2026-10-08: user's updated sample applied (version followup-2026-10-08.4).** Column titles as the user renamed them
  (Day of the Week, Start Time, End Time, Institution Name, Volunteers Needed, Sahaji Contact) plus a new **Principal
  Contact** column, copied to every date and shown on each card under "Details" (phones: tap "Details ▾", kept open across
  refresh; tablets/laptops: always shown), as on the tour page. Old titles still work. One value per line (user's choice):
  a list in Day of the Week / Week of month / Day of month is refused and explained in the Update report (before, it was
  silently cut to one value). Week of month also takes 5th. Sample xlsx, setup guide and organiser narration (o1, o4)
  updated. The user's upload contained phone numbers: only its column titles were used; nothing from it is committed.
  Full test runs: the tour "demo video button" test failed in 2 of 4 runs (passes alone; not touched) - suggested as a
  separate task to fix.
- **2026-10-08: sample sheet for the user.** `docs/followup/sample-followup-sheet.xlsx` (made-up data, built by
  `tools/make_followup_sample.py` from the real `followup/Code.gs`; same data the videos will use). The user will fill a
  copy with real data and share it: keep any real copy (phone numbers) out of the repository.
- **2026-10-08: Follow-up stage 4 started.** Demo button and player added to `followup/Index.html` (same as the tour page;
  hidden until `DEMO_VIDEO_URLS` has links). Narration + captions for approval: `docs/followup/demo-script.md` (Follow-up
  video in en/te/hi; one "Ongoing programs" scene for the tour video, replacing the three Drive files via Manage
  versions; organiser video in English). **User approved the wording as written (2026-10-08) and chose to record only after their real-Google setup check; then voice set-up and recording** (new
  recorder for the Follow-up page modelled on `tools/record_demo.js`; Telugu voice needs the ~7 GB set-up, see above).
- **2026-10-08: Follow-up Program stage 3 BUILT (not run on real Google).** Sheet menu Program -> "Cancellation
  WhatsApp list" (dialog: each affected person, own mobile, green Open WhatsApp button with the ready-written message)
  and "Mark cancellation notices as sent" (Yes/No naming the dates). Setup guide for the new sheet:
  `followup/SETUP_GUIDE.html` (13 parts; template `tools/followup_guide_template.html`). At the user's request the
  "Who: Just me" button moved from the bottom bar to the top, under Mobile (as "Register others" on the tour page).
  VERSION followup-2026-10-08.3. 89 tests. **Next: the user sets up the new sheet with the guide and reports; then
  stage 4 (videos).**
- **2026-10-08: Follow-up Program stage 2b BUILT (not run on real Google).** `followup/Index.html` (VERSION
  followup-2026-10-08.2): "Who" button (speaker list with first-time mobile box, typed others, Include me too) -> one
  Register books the group on every chosen date; confirmation lists each person; ✕ per person you registered and
  "Release all N for this date"; My registrations (count, next date, Show); red cancellation notice at the top (names
  the people you registered there); language switch en/te/hi (Telugu/Hindi NOT checked by native speakers; shared
  phrases copied from the tour page); server messages translated. 87 tests. **Next: the user looks at 2b, then stage 3**
  (WhatsApp list screen + setup guide; plan in `resume.md` section 3).
- **2026-10-08: Follow-up Program stage 2a BUILT (the volunteers' page; English only; not run on real Google).**
  `followup/Index.html` + `doGet` in `followup/Code.gs` (VERSION followup-2026-10-08.1): one-week calendar (Mon-Thu /
  Fri-Sun + week total, arrows move a week), list of the next 2 weeks + "Show 2 more weeks", cards (time, centre,
  address, map, places badge, people, Select / Release / Release closed + organiser phone / Full / Started / Ended /
  Cancelled struck through), bottom bar (count, Clear, repeat in dates or days, Register), confirmation list before
  writing, refresh every 15 s. Cache refresh now uses a counter (a time stamp served stale data in tests). User decisions
  2026-10-08: all 5 stage-1 assumptions confirmed; stage 2 split into 2a/2b (each under 100,000 tokens); Ongoing
  programs demo videos moved to stage 4. **Next: the user looks at 2a, then stage 2b** (plan in `resume.md` section 3).
- **2026-10-07: Follow-up Program stage 1 BUILT (server only; not shown to the user's organisers, never run on real
  Google).** `followup/Code.gs` = the new sheet's server (separate Apps Script project; tour `Code.gs` untouched):
  menu Program -> Set up the sheet / Update slots now, weekly trigger (Sunday 22:00 India), generator for all 7
  frequencies, `getSlots`, `registerSlots` (repeat, register others, preview, limits 10 people / 100 entries),
  `releaseSlot` / `releaseGroup` (12-hour rule), `cancellationList_` / `markNoticeSent_` (private until stage 3).
  Choices the spec left open, and 5 assumptions to confirm with the user: `docs/followup/STAGE1_PLAN.md`.
  Tests: `test/followup.test.js` (8); `test/harness.js` gained stand-ins (script properties, delete/sort rows,
  dropdowns, triggers, `load(..., file)`). Stage 1 used about 120,000 tokens (user approved up to 125,000).
  **2026-10-08: the user confirmed all 5 assumptions and asked for stage 2 (the page, `followup/Index.html` + `doGet`).** Stage 2 must also
  decide how `doGet` passes the first data (as the tour page does) and the page's own VERSION/test strings.
- **2026-10-07: Follow-up Program sign-up (per-date slots) - designed, not built.** Spec with every decision:
  `docs/followup/SPEC.md`; clickable mock-up: `docs/followup/mockup.html`. New sheet + new page link (tour page
  untouched). SPEC section 0 decided: both pages exist; one role (no
  Backup) for now. Calendar layout: "One week" (Mon-Thu / Fri-Sun + week total), confirmed.
  Register others: decision 13 (groups booked even if over the limit; already-full dates skipped). Spec is final.
  Stage 4 added: demo videos in en/te/hi + language-aware demo button on the new page (SPEC section 5).
  Stage 4b added: an organiser demo video for the Program plan and Slots tabs (SPEC section 5). Build in 3 stages (SPEC section 5), confirming each.
- **User: deploy 2026-10-07.1.** Paste both files from SETUP_GUIDE.html, Deploy -> Manage deployments -> edit the
  existing deployment -> New version (keeps the same link). Then check on a phone: the date list ends with "Ongoing
  programs"; a card shows "8 Oct 2026 to 29 Oct 2026 · Weekly · Wed"; Register -> Backup writes column E and sets G;
  Release clears it; the footer reads v2026-10-07.1. Also check: typing a name into a names cell updates its "still
  needed" cell within a second or two; on a phone, the call button next to a name opens the dial pad with the number. If the dates line shows the sheet's text instead of "8 Oct 2026",
  the date cells are text, not real dates (still works, but say so).
- **Moved to Follow-up stage 4 by the user 2026-10-08: demo videos for Ongoing programs** in English, Telugu and Hindi. The recorder
  (tools/record_demo.js, see "Re-record the demo" above) uses a demo copy of the 30-Sep layout; it needs an Ongoing tab
  in its demo data, new steps (pick "Ongoing programs", register as Backup, see it under My Registrations), new voice
  lines in tools/voiceover/lines.json and te/hi/lines.json, then re-pin the GitHub copies and replace the three Drive
  files via Manage versions. Estimated 40,000-60,000 tokens (low confidence).
- Done by the user 2026-10-01: version 2026-10-01.4 is LIVE; the English, Telugu and Hindi demo videos on Drive are
  current and open correctly on computer and phone.
- Open (no code change without the user's go-ahead): does the built-in first-day data (doGet's INITIAL_STATE) reach
  the live page? Definitive check without code: Apps Script editor -> Executions, open the page fresh, compare the
  times of doGet and the first getState after it: about 15 s apart = working (the first getState is the 15-second
  refresh); within about 1-2 s = the page had to ask the server, so investigate.
- User: listen to `docs/demo-te.mp4` and `docs/demo-hi.mp4` and, ideally, have a native Telugu and a native Hindi
  speaker check them (and the page's Telugu/Hindi words). Corrections -> edit lines/captions and re-record.
- Other ideas, not started: reminders one hour before a slot (free: "add to my calendar" button, or an organiser
  list with one-tap WhatsApp links; automatic SMS/WhatsApp needs paid providers + registration); aligning the
  columns of the two laptop tables.
