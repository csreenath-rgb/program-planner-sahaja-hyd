# Speaker Self-Assign page — setup guide

A one-page website where volunteers pick a **date** (today or later) and then schools from **that day's tab** of the
"Hyd 2026 permission Final list" Google Sheet. Claiming a school writes the
volunteer's name and mobile into that row of the sheet, so the sheet and the
page always show the same thing, and two people can never grab the same row.

Two files do everything: `Code.gs` (the logic) and `Index.html` (the page).


> **One-stop guide:** open **`SETUP_GUIDE.html`** (download it and double-click). It has every step
> below plus both code files with Copy buttons. After changing `Code.gs` or `Index.html`,
> rebuild it with `python3 tools/build_guide.py`.


> **Demo video for volunteers:** `docs/demo.mp4` (75 s, with an Indian English female voice-over, shown on a
> phone screen): the school cards and Details, claim, release, register others from the speaker list, and switching language. Recorded from this page's code with a
> demo copy of the 30-Sep layout (made-up names). Re-record with `tools/record_demo.js`, then add the voice with
> `tools/voiceover/mix.py` (the spoken lines are in `tools/voiceover/lines.json`; `make_voice.py` re-speaks them).
> The page's gold **"Watch the 1-minute demo"** button opens the organisers' **Google Drive** copy (first link in
> `DEMO_VIDEO_URLS` in Index.html) in Drive's own player in a new tab. To update that video, upload the new file
> with Drive's **Manage versions** so the link stays the same. If the Drive link is removed, the button instead
> plays the GitHub copies (jsDelivr, then GitHub's raw link, pinned to the commit holding the video) in a pop-up.
> **Telugu and Hindi:** `docs/demo-te.mp4` (78 s) and `docs/demo-hi.mp4` (84 s), recorded with the page in that
> language (`node record_demo.js te` / `hi`; voices from `make_voice_te.py` / `make_voice_hi.py`; then
> `python3 mix.py <ffmpeg> te` / `hi`). The button opens the video for the language chosen on the page: each list in
> `DEMO_VIDEO_URLS` (`en`, `te`, `hi`) starts with that language's Google Drive copy, then the GitHub copies.

## Who must do this

**Someone with EDIT access to the sheet** (ideally the owner). A "View only"
person cannot: the Extensions menu is greyed out for them, and the page writes
to the sheet *as the person who sets it up*. About 10 minutes, on a laptop.

## Before you start: check the sheet's time zone

In the sheet: **File → Settings → Time zone** must be
**(GMT+05:30) India Standard Time**. The page uses this to decide which tab is
"today". Save if you change it.

## Step 1 — Open the script editor

1. Open the Google Sheet.
2. Menu **Extensions → Apps Script**. A new tab opens with a file called `Code.gs`.
3. At the top left, click **Untitled project** and rename it to `Speaker Self-Assign`.

## Step 2 — Paste the code

1. In `Code.gs`, select everything (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A), delete it, and paste the
   full contents of the `Code.gs` file you were given.
2. In the left panel, click **+** next to **Files → HTML**. Name it exactly
   `Index` (the editor adds `.html` itself). Delete what's in it and paste the
   full contents of `Index.html`.
3. Click the **Save** icon (or Ctrl+S / Cmd+S).

## Step 3 — Give it permission (one time)

1. In the toolbar, pick the function **getState** from the dropdown, then click **Run**.
2. A box says **Authorization required** → **Review permissions** → choose your Google account.
3. Google shows **"Google hasn't verified this app"**. This is normal for your own
   scripts. Click **Advanced → Go to Speaker Self-Assign (unsafe) → Allow**.
4. The **Execution log** at the bottom should say *Execution completed*.
   - If it says **"There are no day tabs for today or later yet"**, the script works;
     there's just no tab named like `28-Sep` for today or a later date.
   - Any other red error: send a screenshot of it.

(Only you see this warning. Volunteers using the page never see it.)

## Step 4 — Publish the page

1. Top right: **Deploy → New deployment**.
2. Click the gear next to **Select type** → **Web app**.
3. Fill in:
   - Description: `v1`
   - **Execute as: Me** (your account)
   - **Who has access: Anyone**
4. Click **Deploy**, then copy the **Web app URL** (it ends in `/exec`).
5. Open that URL yourself once to check it shows today's schools.
6. Share that URL with the volunteers, alongside the sheet link.

> If "Anyone" isn't offered (some company/school Google accounts block it),
> deploy from a personal Gmail account that has edit access to the sheet.

## Step 5 — Try it once

On the page: type a test name and mobile, click **Register** on an open row, and
check the name appears in the speaker-name column of today's tab, with the mobile on the
line below it. No other column is touched.
Then click **Release** and check both cells are empty again.

## Rules for the organisers (keep these or the page stops working)

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| Name each day's tab like `28-Sep` (or `5-Oct` / `05-Oct`). | The page finds today's tab by this name. Tabs like `Dummy-26-Sep` or `Summary` are ignored. |
| Past days are view-only. | They stay in the date list marked "(past)" but show greyed out with no Register buttons. Today's slots turn grey ("Ended") once their end time passes (end = time after "to"/dash, else start + 1 hour; blank or "to be confirmed" never ends). The script refuses changes to both, and "Open only" hides them. |
| Fill in a **Time** column (title containing "Time"). | The page reads each school's start time from free text and refuses a second school at the same start time on the same day for the same person. Blank/"to be confirmed" can't be checked. Without AM/PM, 1–5 o'clock = afternoon. |
| Row 1 is the header row. Exactly one header must contain the words **Speaker** and **Name** (e.g. "Sahaja Yoga ( IND) Speaker Name"). | The page writes "name, new line, mobile" into that cell only, the same way organisers already type it. Every other column (including "Local Sahaja Yogi" / "Speaker Mobile") is never touched. |
| A school has room while it has fewer people than its **Total volunteers needed** (1 if blank). | To remove someone, delete their line from the Speaker Name cell. Keep notes like "12 sessions" out of that column: they count as a person. |
| Ongoing programs go on one tab named **Ongoing**, one program per row, with the same Speaker Name / Total volunteers needed / still needed / Time columns as a day tab, plus **Backup Yogis Name**, **Backup yogis needed** (1 if blank, 0 = no backups), **Num of backup yogis still needed** (kept up to date by the page), **Start Date**, **End Date** and **Days of the Week** (e.g. "Mon, Thu" or "Mon to Fri"). | It appears as "Ongoing programs" at the bottom of the date list (the page opens on it once every date is past). Volunteers register as Primary or Backup, not both on one program. Type dates as real sheet dates. A program closes for sign-up after its End Date (no End Date = always open). Same start time on a shared weekday counts as a clash. |
| You can still edit the sheet directly as usual. | The page refreshes every 15 seconds and always shows what's in the sheet. |

At midnight India time the page automatically switches to the new day's tab.

## What volunteers see

- **Adapts to the screen:** on phones and tablets each school is a card (no sideways scrolling); on phones,
  contacts and remarks open with a **Details** tap. Laptops see the full table, with the first columns frozen.
- A **Date** picker (today and later days), and that day's tab with **all columns**, plus **Slots left** (e.g. "1 of 3") and **SY Speaker Name**
  (everyone on the school, with phone numbers). A **Register** button shows on each school
  with a free slot.
- Web addresses in any cell are clickable; Google Maps links show as **Open map** and open in a new tab.
- They type their name and mobile once; the browser remembers both.
- **My Registrations** at the top lists the schools you're on, and those where you registered someone else
  (matched by the name typed in "Your name"). Everything else is under **All Schools**.
- **Open only** tick box hides full and ended schools from "All Schools" (your own stay under My Registrations).
- Their own rows are green with a **Release** button, which removes only their line.
- A school takes people up to its **Total volunteers needed** (any column title
  containing "total" and "volunteer"). Blank or no such column = 1 person; 0 = closed.
  A column titled like **count of Volunteers still needed** ("still" + "volunteer")
  is kept up to date by the page (and, on the Ongoing tab, "Num of backup yogis still needed"): on every registration,
  whenever someone types in a names or "needed" cell, and whenever the page reads the tab. A number typed into it by hand
  is replaced by the calculated one; change the total instead. Past days and cells holding a formula are left alone.
- A school can go **over** its total: everyone is added, the extra people show in red
  "(over limit)" and "Slots left" reads "Over by N". A total of 0 closes the school.
- **Register others:** tick it, list one person per line (name then 10-digit mobile),
  optionally untick "Include me too", then Register. They're written to the sheet as
  `Name mobile (via Registrar)`; the registrar (or the person) can remove them with ✕.
  Every person is validated and time-clash checked; if any fails, nobody is added.
- A person can claim as many rows as they like, but not two with the same start time on a day.
- **Look:** header "Hyderabad 2026 - Self Realization Tour · Schedule & Assignments" with the lotus logo,
  styled after the Sahaja Yoga proposal deck (DM Sans + Instrument Serif from Google Fonts; navy #1A3A5C,
  slate #34485F, gold #C9A84C, pale blue #E1F0FB). The logo is embedded in Index.html (source:
  `assets/lotus.png`), so nothing extra needs hosting.
- **Time zone:** "today"/"now" always use India time (`TIME_ZONE: 'Asia/Kolkata'` in Code.gs), not the
  sheet's setting. The page shows "Sheet time: … · v<VERSION>" so you can check the time and deployed version.
- **Language:** English (default on every open), Telugu or Hindi, from the dropdown at the top. All page
  text and the script's messages switch; sheet contents stay as typed. Translations live in the `TEXT`
  table in `Index.html` (have a native speaker review them).
- **Speaker list:** names come from the **Speaker**/**Speakers** tab (created if missing), shown
  alphabetically: as suggestions in "Your name" (picking one fills the saved mobile) and as a
  searchable multi-select "Choose speakers" under Register others. Everyone registered is saved
  there (new row, or missing mobile filled; a "Mobile" column is added in the first empty column
  the first time). Speakers with no saved number are asked for it once.

## Updating the code later

Paste the new code, save, then **Deploy → Manage deployments → pencil icon →
Version: New version → Deploy**. The URL stays the same. (Using "New
deployment" instead would create a **new** URL.)

## Good to know

- **Names aren't verified.** Anyone with the link can type any name. It's the same
  trust level as letting people edit the sheet. People can only release their own
  place through the page; organisers can always fix things in the sheet.
- **Rows filled in by hand** (a name and number typed together in column B) show as
  taken and can only be changed in the sheet.
- **Privacy:** everything on today's and later days' tabs, including speakers' mobile numbers, is
  visible to anyone with the page link. That's the same as the sheet's current
  "anyone with the link can view" sharing.
- **Capacity:** it comfortably handles dozens of people at once. Google allows
  about 30 script runs at the same moment per account, and each page refresh is a
  short run served from a 5-second shared cache.
- **Safety check:** if someone inserts, deletes or edits a row between a volunteer
  loading the page and clicking Register, the request is refused ("edited or moved")
  instead of landing on the wrong school.
- To test on a copy first: **File → Make a copy** of the sheet *after* Step 2. The copy
  carries its own copy of the script, attached to the copy, so deploy that one to test.
- The script works on the sheet it is attached to (Step 1). To run it as a standalone
  script instead, put the sheet's ID in `SHEET_ID` in `Code.gs`.
  To force a specific tab while testing, set `TAB_NAME_OVERRIDE: '28-Sep'`.

## For developers

`test/` holds a simulated Apps Script environment built to match the layout of the
real `27-Sep` and `28-Sep` tabs, with fake names and numbers (the live sheet couldn't be reached from the build machine).
Run the tests with `cd test && npm install && npm test`
(the page test needs a local Chromium at `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`).
13 tests cover tab selection, claim/release, the two-people race, row-moved
protection, formula-injection and mobile validation, and a real two-browser run.
The Google lock that serialises simultaneous claims is Google's own
`LockService`. The tests simulate it; they can't exercise true parallelism.
